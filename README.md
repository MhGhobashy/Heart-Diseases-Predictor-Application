# Heart-Diseases-Predictor-Application
This is an android application made using Java that uses machine learning model to predict the possibility of heart diseases occurance

You can view the model used in this application here: [Heart Diseases Predictor Application](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mghobashy/heart-diseases-predictor-application?scriptVersionId=153284807)

The model itself in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall is doing a great job, but the dataset needs some cleaning because there's a couple of rows that don't make any sense, medically speaking.
The application has 3 pages:

which contains explanation about chest pain and its values and exercise induced angina, and information about causes, preventions, and near hospitals and doctors

This model was deployed using Flask and Render.com. Although render is somehow slow, but it's one of the best free options.
