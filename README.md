The model itself in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall is doing a great job, but the dataset needs some cleaning because there's a couple of rows that don't make any sense, medically speaking.
The application has 3 pages:

This model was deployed using Flask and Render.com. Although render is somehow slow, but it's one of the best free options.
